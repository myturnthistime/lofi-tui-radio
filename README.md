# Lofi TUI Radio
A very simple golang TUI app for linux that displays lofi girls YouTube channels (and a few more) and allows you to select which one you'd like to open in streamlink

Useful because
- going on youtube is full of distractions and that is the last thing you want if you're trying to study/chill

Requires
- streamlink to be installed, which is avaliable on all good package managers

To install
- clone it, build it and copy it to your /bin/ folder

Notes
- q will quit without opening a stream, the interface will close automatically when you select a stream
